# Environments

Environments are used to dynamically create, modify, and do various other things with variables.

You can get started with environments by getting the current, inner-most (as in the scope where new defined variables will be stored) environment the interpreter is using. Just use the `environment` keyword to do so:

```
env => environment
```

`env` now stores the interpreter's environment -- basically it's a container for all the variables within the (implicitly) given scope.

You can access the value of the variable "foo" like so:

```
env.foo
```

And you can set it to 42 like so:

```
env.foo > 42;
```

Setting a variable using the environment will dynamically create it within the scope:

```
print(foo); # 42 #
```

Using this method of setting a variable is equivalent to assigning a variable: `env.var > val` is the same as `var => val`.

You can also make a variable with `variable_make`:

```
variable_make(env, 'foo', 42);
```

## Raw variables

You can access the raw variable objects using `variable_raw`:

```
foo_var => variable_raw(env, 'foo'); # <Variable> #
```

Variables can be changed with `variable_change`:

```
variable_change(foo_var, 'new foo value');
```

The value of a variable can be gotten with `variable_value`:

```
print(variable_value(foo_var)); # new foo value #
```

You can't get a non-existant variable:

```
variable_raw(env, 'fake_variable') # error #
```

You can use `variable_exists` to check if a variable exists within a given environment:

```
variable_exists(env, 'fake_variable') # false #
variable_exists(env, 'foo') # true #
```
